      <p><b>If the heart rate is normal, continue to ventilate until the baby is breathing.</b><br>Look for the babyâ€™s
        breathing. Stop ventilation when the baby is breathing and the heart rate stays normal.</p>
      <p><b>If the heart rate is normal, but the baby is not breathing or is gasping, continue ventilation and
        re-evaluate breathing and heart rate.</b></p>
      <p><b>If the heart rate is slow, make sure that you have taken all the steps to improve ventilation and
        re-evaluate breathing and heart rate.</b><br> A skilled helper can continuously evaluate chest rise and heart
        rate.</p>
      <p><b>A baby who needs continued ventilation will need advanced care.</b><br>
        Activate the emergency plan to seek consultation or advanced care at a specialty facility. Continue ventilation
        during transport if the baby will be moved for advanced care. If advanced care or suitable transport is not
        available, discuss with parents and consider stopping ventilation after 20 minutes if heart rate is slow or the
        baby does not breathe.</p>
