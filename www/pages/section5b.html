      <ul style="margin-top:0">
        <li><b>Wipe (immediate pre-cleaning):</b> While wearing gloves, wipe the
          outside of the ventilation bag and mask with a gauze soaked in 0.5%
          chlorine solution. Also wipe the outside of a bulb suction device.
          If the suction device cannot be opened for cleaning inside, discard
          it after use.
        </li>
        <li><b>Disassemble:</b> Take apart the devices completely.</li>
        <li><b>Clean:</b> Wash in warm soapy water to remove visible blood,
          secretions, and other contaminated matter.
        </li>
        <li><b>Sterilize or high-level disinfect:</b> Sterilize all parts by autoclaving
          or high-level disinfect parts by boiling or steaming for 20 minutes or
          submersion in an appropriate chemical disinfectant. Rinse in boiled
          water after chemical disinfection.
        </li>
        <li><b>Dry:</b> Allow all parts to dry completely before reassembly.</li>
        <li><b>Reassemble:</b> Inspect all pieces for cleanliness and damage. Put
          together the pieces of the ventilation bag and mask and suction
          device.

      <ul style="margin-top:0">
        <li>Put the mask on the ventilation
          bag. Squeeze the bag and
          look for the valve in the patient
          outlet to open as you squeeze.
          This shows the device is ready
          to deliver air to a patient.<br>

          hand and squeeze hard enough to open
          the pressure release valve. Listen for the
          sound of air escaping. This shows that air
          which cannot be delivered safely to the
          baby will escape through the pressure
          release valve.<br>

          Maintain the tight seal and check
          that the bag re-inflates after each
          squeeze. This shows that fresh
          air will enter the bag through
          the inlet valve.<br>

          Squeeze the bottom portion of

          The suction device should not expand until the tip is unblocked.
