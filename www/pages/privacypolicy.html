      <p>Limitation of Liability <br/>
        Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
        shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
        direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation,
        damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other

        party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the
        exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply
