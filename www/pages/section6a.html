      <p>Improving care saves lives. Knowing the right
        care to give is not always enough to save
        babies’ lives—that knowledge must be put
        into practice.</p>
      <p>Completing a workshop in <b>Helping Babies
        Breathe</b> is just the first step in improving the
        care that you give.</p>
      <p>After the course, <b>commit to making a
        difference by:</b><br><br>
        <b>(1) Identify areas that need improvement</b>
        Identify differences between what is
        recommended and what is done at your
        facility. Use the Action Plan, the<i> Questions to
          improve care and What to monitor.</i>
        <br><br>
        <b>(2) Create a system for ongoing practice
          and review of cases</b>
        Master the <i>Action Plan</i> by participating in
        ongoing practice, reviewing your actions every
        time you help a baby breathe, and using case
        reviews and audits to identify areas that need
        improvement.
        <br><br>
        <b>(3) Make changes that will improve care</b>
        Work with others on a plan to improve care
        and take action in your facility.
