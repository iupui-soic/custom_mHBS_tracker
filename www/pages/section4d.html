      <p><b>If referral is needed, transport mother and baby together</b><br>
        Every facility should have guidelines for consultation or referral of babies who need help with breathing,
        feeding or temperature. Monitor the baby frequently before and during transport. Communicate the actions you
        have taken and your assessment to the responsible person at the receiving facility. Try to keep mother and baby
        together during transfer, even if only one is ill. Skin-to-skin care during transport facilitates observation
        and keeps the
        baby warm. Consider if alternative methods of feeding are needed.</p>

      <p><b>Support the family.</b><br>
        If a baby needed help to breathe, explain what happened and what care will be given. Answer the family’s
        questions or find help to answer them. The mother may need help to express breast milk. If a baby is ill
        or dies, respond in a culturally appropriate way. Respect the family’s wishes, privacy, and religious beliefs.
        Give the mother advice on breast care and family planning.</p>
      <p><b>Prepare for the next time a baby needs help to breathe.</b><br>
        Review the actions taken with other team members. Disinfect the ventilation bag, mask, and suction device. Store
        the
        equipment in a place where it will stay clean and available for use (see page 46).</p>
